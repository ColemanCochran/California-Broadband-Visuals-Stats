# California Broadband Coverage Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes broadband coverage across California to identify potential market opportunities for Starlink. By processing and visualizing data on 5G, 4G, and 3G coverage across approximately 5,000 locations in California, this analysis highlights areas with inadequate service that could benefit from Starlink's offerings.

## Data Source
- Comprehensive dataset of broadband coverage across 5,496 places in California
- Dataset includes coverage percentages for 5G, 4G, 3G, and subcategories
- Places are categorized (rural, urban, etc.) in the source data

## Visualizations
- Bar charts showing average coverage percentages across different town categories
- Distribution chart of places by coverage percentage ranges
- Interactive map visualization with:
  - Color-coded locations based on coverage quality
  - Separate maps for 4G and 5G coverage
  - Yellow dots indicating adequate coverage
  - Orange/red dots indicating poor coverage

## How to View Findings
- Graphs: All have been saved to png folder
- Map: Download html file in the html folder --> open in browser

## Potential Applications
- Target Starlink marketing and sales efforts to identified areas with poor coverage
- Focus on both clustered regions of poor service and individual high-value locations
- Use as proof-of-concept for more comprehensive analysis with FCC or SpaceX's proprietary data

## How to Improve / Future Development
- Enhance with higher quality data (FCC website underwent maintenance during project)
- Expand analysis to additional regions
- Incorporate service quality metrics beyond simple coverage percentages
- Find data to explore starlink distribution and barriers to entry

## Setup
- (Recommended) Create your own virual environment
- Download requirements.txt
- Test
