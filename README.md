# California Broadband Coverage Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes broadband coverage across California to identify potential market opportunities for Starlink. By processing and visualizing data on 5G, 4G, and 3G coverage across approximately 5,000 locations in California, this analysis highlights areas with inadequate service that could benefit from Starlink's offerings.

## Data Source
- Comprehensive dataset of broadband coverage across 5,000 places in California
- Dataset includes coverage percentages for 5G, 4G, 3G, and subcategories
- Places are categorized (rural, urban, etc.) in the source data

## Key Findings
- In rural California towns, only ~50% of the area is covered by 5G service
- 107 towns/places in California have only 10-20% coverage of 4G and 5G
- Coverage quality data isn't included, making these findings conservative estimates
- Identified clusters of poorly-served areas and individual locations with surprisingly poor coverage (e.g., Malibu with only 16% 5G coverage, Rancho Palos Verdes)

## Visualizations
- Bar charts showing average coverage percentages across different town categories
- Distribution chart of places by coverage percentage ranges
- Interactive map visualization with:
  - Color-coded locations based on coverage quality
  - Separate maps for 4G and 5G coverage
  - Yellow dots indicating adequate coverage
  - Orange/red dots indicating poor coverage

## Potential Applications
- Target Starlink marketing and sales efforts to identified areas with poor coverage
- Focus on both clustered regions of poor service and individual high-value locations
- Use as proof-of-concept for more comprehensive analysis with SpaceX's proprietary data

## Future Development
- Enhance with higher quality data from SpaceX
- Expand analysis to additional regions
- Incorporate service quality metrics beyond simple coverage percentages
